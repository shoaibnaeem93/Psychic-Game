# Psychic-Game

How the App works
1) The app selects a random letter from A-Z. 
2) The user must then guess the randomly chosen letter by pressing different letters on their keyboard within the allotted guesses available. 
3) If the user presses a letter key on the keyboard that matches the random letter selected by the app within the amount of guesses available, the user wins. 
4) If the user does not guess the correct letter and all the guesses are used, the user loses. 
5) If the user wins or loses, the app resets to the start of the game with user wins and losses count updated.

The app was made using basic web development tools: HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
